# 📊 Advertising Sales Prediction using Linear Regression

## 🚀 Project Overview
This project builds a **Linear Regression** model to predict **sales revenue** based on advertising budgets spent on **TV, Radio, and Newspaper ads**.  
The dataset helps analyze the impact of different advertising channels on sales.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Python** 🐍  
- **Pandas** (Data Manipulation)  
- **Scikit-Learn** (Machine Learning)  
- **NumPy** (Numerical Computations)  
- **Jupyter Notebook** / **Google Colab** (Optional for running the model)  

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset consists of **1000 rows** with the following columns:  

| Column      | Description |
|------------|------------|
| **TV**         | Budget spent on TV ads ($1000s) |
| **Radio**      | Budget spent on Radio ads ($1000s) |
| **Newspaper**  | Budget spent on Newspaper ads ($1000s) |
| **Sales**      | Generated Sales ($1000s) **(Target Variable)** |
